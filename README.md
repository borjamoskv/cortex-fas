# CORTEX-FAS v6 — Adversarial Compliance Simulator

## Regulatory Stress Test Engine for Jurisprudential Systems

CORTEX-FAS is a computational framework for modeling **interpretative drift under adversarial assumption sets** in fiscal and regulatory systems.

It simulates how legal interpretations evolve under:
- internal precedent accumulation.
- external legislative shocks.
- threshold reconfiguration dynamics.

## Core Principle

This system does **not**:
- produce legal conclusions.
- assign liability.
- provide tax advice.
- evaluate real-world compliance status.

It **does**:
- simulate structural sensitivity of legal interpretation.
- model regime transitions under assumption perturbations.
- compute abstract stability metrics over jurisprudential state spaces.

## Formal Core

### Juridical Energy Function (JEF)

`E_total` is a normalized scalar potential over interpretative tension fields, combining:
- correlation pressure.
- threshold variance.
- doctrinal entropy.
- precedent friction.

Outputs are normalized to the range `[0, 1]`.

### Lyapunov Proxy

Measures sensitivity of interpretative systems to small perturbations:

`λ ≈ divergence rate of energy trajectories under epsilon shocks`

### Regime Space

- Stable Formalism.
- Interpretative Drift.
- Doctrinal Tension.
- Phase Transition.

## Adversarial Assumption Layer

All outputs are conditional on explicit assumption sets.

No assumption is treated as factual.

All simulations are counterfactual by design.

## Example Use Case

**iHelp Stress Test** is a synthetic scenario used to evaluate:
- coupling sensitivity between donation and service structures.
- interpretative boundary behavior under strict enforcement assumptions.

This is **not** a real-world classification.

## Architecture

- `core/` — state machine + energy model.
- `model/` — ontology + graph layer.
- `api/` — simulation endpoints.
- `dashboard/` — interpretability UI.
- `case_studies/` — synthetic stress scenarios.

## Output Philosophy

All outputs are:
- probabilistic.
- assumption-conditioned.
- non-normative.
- non-decisional.

## Safety Boundary

This system cannot be used as:
- evidence in legal proceedings.
- compliance certification tool.
- tax determination engine.

It is strictly a research simulation environment.
